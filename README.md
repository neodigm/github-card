Minimal sample for embedding for the `sveltejs/svelte` repo

```html
<github-card repo="sveltejs/svelte">
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/reddec/github-card@1/dist/github-card.min.js"></script>
</github-card>
```

Additional flags:

* `flat="yes"` - disables card shadow
* `plain="yes"` - disables logo for the repository

## Features

* ultra light - 12KB without gzip (4.5KB - gzipped)
* easy to use
* powered by Svelte

## Reason

I wanted to add nice Github card to my blog, but I didn't want to learn PHP (wordpress).
